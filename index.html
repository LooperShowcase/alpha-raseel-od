  <h1>SUPRA MK4</h1>

    <p>
      The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota Sūpura) is a
      sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation
      beginning in 1978. The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix,
      meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond".[3] The initial four
      generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth
      generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May
      2019.[4] The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota
      Celica, but it was both longer and wider.[5] Starting in mid-1986, the A70
      Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also
      stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra.[6] Owing to the
      similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for
      the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the
      Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the
      fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The
      5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz,
      Austria by Magna Steyr. The Supra also traces much of its roots back to
      the 2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout. The first three generations were
      offered with a direct descendant to the Crown's and 2000GT's M engine.
      Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code "A".
